# MFSDS: Mathematical Formula for Systematic Digestive Sounds

## 📘 Introduction

This project is based on the research article _"Toward a Mathematical Approach to Sound Waves for Enhancing Digestive Health"_. It presents a novel approach to digestive health monitoring by analyzing intestinal sound waves and converting them into mathematical formulas using signal processing and artificial intelligence.

The core of this project is the **MFSDS** (Mathematical Formula for Systematic Digestive Sounds), which applies techniques such as the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** and **VGG16 neural network** to extract features from digestive audio data. These features are compared to a predefined set of mathematical expressions to identify patterns that may reflect different gastrointestinal states.

Although still experimental, this method offers a new perspective on **non-invasive**, **real-time** digestive health diagnostics, with potential applications in clinical, occupational, and home health settings.
